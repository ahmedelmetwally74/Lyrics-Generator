# Lyrics Generator

## Overview
The Lyrics Generator is a deep learning project designed to create song lyrics in both Arabic and English. Users can input an opening sentence, and the model will automatically generate the continuation of the lyrics, crafting a complete song based on the initial prompt.

## Motivation
Creating authentic and engaging song lyrics using AI presents a unique challenge, particularly in maintaining the lyrical flow and thematic consistency. This project aims to explore the capabilities of language models in creative text generation and to provide a tool for artists and creators to generate lyrical ideas effortlessly.

## Data Collection
Due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets for song lyrics in Arabic and English, we embarked on creating our own datasets:

- **English Dataset**: [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedelmetwally/english-dataset-preprocessing/input?scriptVersionId=191456051&select=english_lyrics_df.csv)
- **Arabic Dataset**: [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedelmetwally/english-dataset-preprocessing/input?scriptVersionId=191456051&select=arabic_lyrics_df.csv)

These datasets were meticulously compiled to ensure a diverse range of song lyrics covering various themes and genres.

## Technical Details
The Lyrics Generator leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the technical setup:
- **Language Models**: Describe the specific models or architecture you're using, such as GPT-2, LSTM, etc.
- **Framework**: Tools and libraries used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **API**: Explanation of how the API works (if applicable).

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the project locally:
```bash
